Description: surtvep is an R package for fitting Cox non-proportional hazards models with time-varying coefficients. 
  Both unpenalized procedures (Newton and proximal Newton) and penalized procedures (P-splines and smoothing splines) are included using B-spline basis functions for estimating time-varying coefficients. 
  For penalized procedures, cross-validations, mAIC, TIC or GIC are implemented to select tuning parameters. 
  Utilities for carrying out post-estimation visualization, summarization, point-wise confidence interval and hypothesis testing are also provided.
