\title{Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment
(SUPPORT)}
\format{
A data frame with 9,104 observations and 34 variables after imputation
and the removal of response variables like hospital charges, patient ratio
of costs to charges and micro-costs following Bhatnagar et al. (2020).
Ordinal variables, namely functional disability and income, were also removed.
Finally, Surrogate activities of daily living were removed due to sparsity.
There were 6 other model scores in the data-set and they were removed; only aps and sps were kept.

\description{
The SUPPORT dataset tracks five response variables: hospital
death, severe functional disability, hospital costs, and time until death
and death itself. The patients are followed for up to 5.56 years.
}
\details{
Some of the original data was missing. Before imputation, there were
a total of 9,104 individuals and 47 variables. Following Bhatnagar et al. (2020), a few variables
were removed. Three response variables were removed:
hospital charges, patient ratio of costs to charges and patient
micro-costs. Hospital death was also removed as it was directly informative
of the event of interest, namely death. Additionally, functional disability and
income were removed as they are ordinal covariates. Finally, 8
covariates were removed related to the results of previous findings: SUPPORT
day 3 physiology score (\code{sps}), APACHE III day 3 physiology score
(\code{aps}), SUPPORT model 2-month survival estimate, SUPPORT model
6-month survival estimate, Physician's 2-month survival estimate for pt.,
Physician's 6-month survival estimate for pt., Patient had Do Not
Resuscitate (DNR) order, and Day of DNR order (<0 if before study). Of
these, \code{sps} and \code{aps} were added on after imputation, as they
were missing only 1 observation. First the imputation is done manually using the normal
values for physiological measures recommended by Knaus et al. (1995). Next,
a single dataset was imputed using \pkg{mice} with default settings. After
imputation, the covariate for surrogate activities of daily
living was not imputed. This is due to collinearity between the other two
covariates for activities of daily living. Therefore, surrogate activities
of daily living were removed. See details in the R package (casebase) by Bhatnagar et al. (2020).
